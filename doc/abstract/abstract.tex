\title{ext3Viewer - an ext3 filesystem low level viewer}
\author{Laurent Sebag \and Nathan Periana}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\subsubsection*{}
The main goal of the ext3Viewer project is to give the user the possibility to
explore the ext3 filesystem at a low-level.
\subsubsection*{}
The ext3 filesystem uses metadata to organize files and to preserve its 
integrity. This metadata is not accessible to the normal user.
\subsubsection*{}
ext3Viewer has been designed for computing science students who already know 
ext3. It enables them to access all the opaques structures of their partition,
so they can have a better understanding of the physical storage of the data.
\subsubsection*{}
The ext3Viewer project idea came from Mr. Konstantin Verchinine; it could
replace the e2view projet, used during the ASR lessons.
