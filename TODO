Altough the project works pretty well there are still things to correct.
Here is the TODO list :

 - cleaning code : a lot of the source code should be cleaned ; output functions
   have to be rewritten so that the same functions for the gui and the console
   could be called

 - find more details and specs about jbd

 - implement a complete acl functionality 

 - implement help functions in the gui : it could explain how the filesystem
   works... like lesson for IT students

 - improve interactivity in the gui. eg.: block number could be links for 
   bpoint

 - implement input of files as a string. ex: /etc/foo.conf

 - ... and many other things
